# Suicidal Detection OnSIDe-Bert-CNN-BERT-CNN-

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on detecting suicidal ideation in text using a hybrid deep learning model, OnSIDe-Bert-CNN. This model combines BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for contextual embedding and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.

## About the Project

This project aims to develop an effective and robust model for detecting suicidal ideation in text data. The model utilizes a hybrid architecture, OnSIDe-Bert-CNN, which leverages the strengths of both BERT and CNNs to achieve high accuracy in sentiment classification. This project is intended for research and educational purposes, specifically in the field of AI Applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `suicide_detection.csv`, which contains text data labeled as either "suicide" or "non-suicide." The dataset is located in the `data/` directory.
